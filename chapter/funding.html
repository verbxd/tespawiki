May vary per campus.</i></h3><ol><li>Hold a strategy meeting with your officers well in advance of your event. Identify goals, constraints, responsibilities, and a basic agenda — what does your ideal event look like, and what does it accomplish?<ol><li>Naturally, a fundraising event should raise money, but it can also be social or competitive.</li></ol></li><li>After your strategy meeting, select a venue for your event.<ol><li>Reach out to local businesses — many have fundraising programs specifically for students.</li><li>Consult with your faculty advisor or events office to see if your campus has fundraising rules.</li></ol></li><li>Publish your event on an events platform like Facebook or <a href="https://my.tespa.org/"><u>MyTespa</u></a>, then use social media and available campus marketing options to promote your event to members and students.<ol><li>Since you’re selling something, make sure you clearly advertise the price and value.</li></ol></li><li>Before the event, arrive early with your officers to set up the room, prepare the sales process, and review roles and responsibilities.<ol><li>Consider having a digital payment option available, like PayPal, Square, or Venmo.</li></ol></li><li>During your event, stay alert, be flexible, and prioritize the attendee experience. Nobody expects a club event to run perfectly, but members do expect events to feel like a welcoming place. If you stay positive and provide a great attendee experience, you can’t have a bad event.</li></ol><h2>Considerations</h2><h3><i>Generalized. May vary per campus.</i></h3><ul><li>Some fundraising event suggestions…<ul><li>Food and drink sales, “Play the Pro” competitions, charity LAN events, merchandise sales, paid raffles, coaching or tutorial sessions.</li></ul></li><li>Sell the “why”, not the ‘what” — members are going to care more about why they’re contributing to the cause, not what they’ll be paying for.</li><li>Look into whether your campus offers tax-exempt club bank accounts. If students are paying to your personal bank account, you’ll have to pay taxes on any funds you raise.<ul><li>Some club bank accounts will have restrictions on when and how you can withdraw money.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Resources</h2><h3><i>Templates and examples from existing Tespa resources or external sources.</i></h3><p>Philanthropic Organizations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?"><u>Extra Life</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.stjude.org/"><u>St. Jude’s Children Research Hospital</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ablegamers.org/"><u>The AbleGamers Charity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"><u>Doctors Without Borders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://preventcancer.org/"><u>Prevent Cancer Foundation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/"><u>Save the Children</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx"><u>Conservation International</u></a></li></ul><p>Event Examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460979025842798623/479365999422996481/Screen_Shot_2018-08-15_at_12.09.03_PM.png"><u>Pay to Pie Your Officers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/"><u>Games Done Quick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr4MoNDiRXk"><u>Smash the Record</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1992855167655796/"><u>It’s Just a Game</u></a> - Rutgers Esports</li></ul>
